The original submission I'm polishing is my First Person Shooter game

For bugs, the jumping system works, previously the player would float if they got off the ramp.

The visuals are the same except I replaced the bullet with the shuriken I made for the Blender assignment and have one in the players hand so they can always see it ready.

Controls: WASD, Left click to shoot, Space bar to jump

The gold sphere towards the end will increase your jump height, allowing you to reach platforms to aim at hidden ninjas.
